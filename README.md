# P2P File Transfer Project
A P2P network consisting of a centralised directory tracker and peers. Peers are able to inform the tracker on new files available for sharing, as well as download desired chunks of files from other peers. The tracker maintains a database of these chunk entries and pass information to the peers upon request. In this system, only text files are allow for transfer.

Report can be found [here](docs/Report.pdf)
